# Category Management Implementation Plan

## Objective

Implement complete category management functionality in ExpenseVault, including create, modify, and delete operations with proper UI/UX and backend workflow.

## Analysis Summary

The application already has partial category management functionality implemented. The backend has commands, queries, and controller endpoints for CRUD operations, while the frontend has components for listing categories and basic editing. We need to enhance the implementation with proper form components, validation, and user experience flows.

## Proposed Approach

We'll implement each story (create, modify, delete) as a complete vertical slice, including backend validation, API endpoints, and frontend UI/UX. We'll use the existing CQRS architecture and leverage the current category components.

## Detailed Stories

### Story 1: Create Category

**Description**: Users should be able to create new expense categories with proper validation and UX feedback.

#### Backend Tasks

- Review and enhance the `CreateCategoryCommand` and validation
- Ensure proper error handling in the command handler
- Verify domain event generation and processing
- Add validation for required fields and data formats

#### Frontend Tasks

- Create a new `CategoryForm` component for adding categories
- Implement validation for required fields
- Add avatar selection/upload functionality
- Connect form to Redux actions and sagas
- Add success/error notifications
- Implement navigation back to categories list after creation

### Story 2: Modify Category

**Description**: Users should be able to edit existing categories with proper validation and UX feedback.

#### Backend Tasks

- Review and enhance the `UpdateCategoryCommand` and validation
- Ensure proper error handling in the command handler
- Verify domain event generation and processing
- Add validation to prevent invalid updates

#### Frontend Tasks

- Enhance the existing CategoryPage to properly handle edits
- Improve form validation and error handling
- Implement proper loading states
- Add success/error notifications
- Add cancel button and confirmation if changes were made

### Story 3: Delete Category

**Description**: Users should be able to delete categories with proper validation, confirmation, and handling of dependencies.

#### Backend Tasks

- Review and enhance the `DeleteCategoryCommand` and validation
- Implement proper handling of categories referenced by expenses
- Ensure proper error handling in the command handler
- Verify domain event generation and processing

#### Frontend Tasks

- Add confirmation dialog before deletion
- Implement proper error handling for failed deletions
- Show success notification after deletion
- Refresh category list after successful deletion
- Handle error cases where deletion is prevented

## Key Files/Modules

### Backend

- `EV.Application/Categories/Commands/CreateCategory/`
- `EV.Application/Categories/Commands/UpdateCategory/`
- `EV.Application/Categories/Commands/DeleteCategory/`
- `EV.Application/Categories/Handlers/`
- `ExpenseVault.Server/Controllers/Category/CategoryController.cs`

### Frontend

- `expensevault.client/src/features/category/components/CategoryForm.tsx` (to be created)
- `expensevault.client/src/features/category/category-page.tsx`
- `expensevault.client/src/features/category/categories-page.tsx`
- `expensevault.client/src/features/category/hooks/use-category.ts`
- `expensevault.client/src/features/category/store/category-saga.ts`
- `expensevault.client/src/features/category/store/category-slice.ts`

## Verification Strategy

- Unit tests for command validators and handlers
- Manual testing of API endpoints using Swagger
- UI testing for form validation and error handling
- Verify proper navigation flows between pages
- Test deletion scenarios with referenced categories

## Implementation Considerations

1. **Category Dependencies**: Categories may be referenced by expenses. We need to decide whether to implement soft delete or prevent deletion of used categories.

2. **Multilingual Support**: Category names and descriptions are stored as dictionaries to support multiple languages. The UI should provide appropriate inputs for this.

3. **Avatar Handling**: Category avatars are stored as URLs. We need to implement proper input and validation for these.

4. **Validation Rules**: Category names should be required, and we should implement appropriate length and format validations.

5. **User Experience**: Implement proper loading states, error handling, and success notifications for a seamless user experience.

## Timeline

- Story 1 (Create): 3 days
- Story 2 (Modify): 2 days
- Story 3 (Delete): 2 days
- Testing & Refinement: 1 day

**Total: 8 days**
