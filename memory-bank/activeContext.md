# Active Context: ExpenseVault

## Current Sprint Focus

The team is currently focused on implementing core expense tracking functionality, with emphasis on:

1. Expense entry and management features
2. Category management system
3. Basic reporting and visualization
4. Authentication and user management

## Recent Work Completed

- Established Clean Architecture project structure with domain-driven design
- Implemented basic authentication with JWT tokens and refresh capabilities
- Created core domain models for expenses, categories, and accounts
- Set up basic CRUD operations for categories
- Configured Entity Framework Core with SQL Server
- Initialized React frontend with Vite and TypeScript

## Key Decisions

### Architecture Decisions

- **Clean Architecture**: Adopted to maintain separation of concerns and testability
- **CQRS Pattern**: Implemented using MediatR for clear separation of reads and writes
- **JWT Authentication**: Selected for stateless authentication with refresh token rotation
- **Entity Framework Core**: Chosen as ORM for data access with code-first approach

### Frontend Decisions

- **React 19**: Selected for UI development with functional components and hooks
- **TypeScript**: Required for all frontend code to ensure type safety
- **Tailwind & DaisyUI**: Adopted for styling and component library
- **Vite**: Selected as build tool for faster development experience

### Backend Decisions

- **.NET 8**: Selected for backend development
- **ASP.NET Core**: Used for API development with controller-based endpoints
- **FluentValidation**: Implemented for robust request validation
- **Swagger/OpenAPI**: Used for API documentation and testing

## Current Technical Challenges

1. **Performance Optimization**: Ensuring efficient handling of large expense datasets
2. **Security Implementation**: Finalizing security best practices for financial data
3. **Data Modeling**: Refining relationships between expenses, categories, and accounts
4. **UI/UX Refinement**: Improving user experience for expense entry workflows

## Team Collaboration

- Backend and frontend teams working collaboratively on feature implementation
- Daily stand-ups to coordinate development efforts
- Code reviews required for all pull requests
- Documentation updated alongside code changes

## Next Steps

1. Complete implementation of expense management features
2. Enhance reporting capabilities with charts and filters
3. Implement user preference settings
4. Add export functionality for reports and data
5. Begin work on budget planning features

## Open Questions

- How should recurring expenses be modeled?
- What level of granularity is needed for expense categorization?
- How should we approach multiple currency support?
- What additional security measures are needed for financial data?
